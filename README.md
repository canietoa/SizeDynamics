# SizeDynamics
Repository developed by Cesar Augusto Nieto Acuna (2022). University of Delaware. cnieto@udel.edu.

This Repository contains:

"RawDataAdder.csv" Cell size trajectories for E. coli bacteria growing in M9+Glucose (3 Replicae)


"RawDataSizer.csv" Cell size trajectories for E. coli bacteria growing in M9+Glycerol (3 Replicae)


"DataAnalysis.ipynb" Python notebook to analyze the data above. As result, you can obtain the moment dynamics of the cell size distribution, dynamics of the cell size ACF, division strategy and a measurement of noises of partitioning and growth rate.
